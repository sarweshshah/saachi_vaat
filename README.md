# Saachi Vaat ðŸ“¢
Saachi Vaat is a sound installation designed for the 4th Edition of Abhivyakti (Ahmedabad Art Festival) that explores the distortion that is inherirent in the transmission of information, especially in a post-truth society. 

The installation employes an array of speakers and microphones installed in 7 terracotta chambers and record and play spoken voice through the chambers in multiple hops, in the meantime also picking environmental noise and resonant frequencies. These 14 sound devices (7 input and 7 output) are controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4 that also converts recorded sound in the system for archival purposes.
